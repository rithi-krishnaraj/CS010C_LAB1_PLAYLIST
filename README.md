This project creates a Playlist Manager program in C++ using a Linked List. The program allows users to create and manage a playlist. An interactive menu includes the following options until the user chooses to quit the program: adding a song, removing a song, changing the position of a song, outputting songs by artist, outputting the full playlist time, and outputting the total playlist time. The project is organized into three files, Playlist.h, Playlist.cpp, and main.cpp
